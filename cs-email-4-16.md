Hi Nicole,

Thanks for getting back to me with the Social info. Here's where we stand:

1. All Positions page is complete, save a revision to the scaling (viewbox) for "Split Screening," which I will attempt to edit myself.
WILL SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO YOU GUYS

2. I am extrapolating updated Chapter Page layouts based on the All Positions grid revision you provided. Previous to the layouts, I was using a script to automatically shuffle the positions to fill the available space. Since each of these now has a defined static (not dynamic) layout, each takes time to code as if it were an additional page, and I anticipate needing to bill a few extra hours (about 1 per cancer type) as a result.

3. Social Sharing: There are about 8 hours of work here per my SOW, to assure that all Social integrations are thoroughly QAed. This is an important facet of our strategy, so its important that each platform works seamlessly on day one.

4. There is copy in the Social doc for "Probe Officer," but that position seems to be missing from the layouts and SVGs. XXX

5. I am also in the process of configuring the email forwarding you requested. This requires some reconfiguration with your domain registrar NetworkSolutions, as well as some server side work.

6. Email sharing also requires some server-side work. We cannot use visitor's email accounts to send these messages, as the web simply does not allow click-to-send emails with images, only text. Because of this, all emails will need to come from xxxx@cancersutra.com. Please let me know what email address you'd like to use. info@cancersutra.com // no-reply@cancersutra.com

7. Further server configuration for Social Sharing (see: our discussion about pseudo pages from earlier discussions), is also in progress but cannot be completely tested until everything else, including our Social Images strategy, is complete.

8. Facebook and Twitter use the same platform "OpenGraph" to supply page information upon sharing. This means that there can only be one source of information for the description. Scanning the differences between Facebook and Twitter descriptions, it seems that the only difference is the existence of a hashtag. Since Facebook supports hashtags as well, would it be acceptable to show them on both platforms? XXX

9. In order to collect insights and analytics from Twitter/Facebook/Tumblr, we'll need to attribute posts to an account on each respective platform. Is creating a Facebook page / Twitter User / Tumblr for Cancer Sutra already part of the plan? 

10. We also discussed adding Google Analytics to cancersutra.com. This would give us the advantage of tracking user interactions throughout the site. We can then use conclusions drawn from this data to make site changes as necessary to encourage conversions.

11. The Support page is a bit more elaborate than we originally discussed. It will take me slightly more time than anticipated, outside of the range I provided earlier. Since it's a secondary page, it will live at /support/ebook. Let me know if you have a different URL in mind.

At this point a launch date of the 22nd is too aggressive. I still need my quoted cross-browser QA time, which is essential to assure the site performs as expected. It's also important make sure each facet of our Social plan is thoroughly tested before launch.

It's unfortunate that we directed our attention elsewhere toward the end of March, in light the quick turnaround with your new sponsor, but considering the number of moving parts here, we're better off not rushing things.

I will be out of town for the next few days, but will make an effort have the site itself available to you for QA ASAP. Then it would be ideal to take another week to make sure our Social Media strategy is down pat. Would you be amenable to a first week of May launch?

Once I have some feedback from my points above, I can provide a 6th SOW complete with updated quote and schedule.

Thanks,

Connor
