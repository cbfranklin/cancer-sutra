							<p>Position yourself in a seated, half-upright position on a bed or deep chair, and bend your knee so that it can be kept effortlessly raised.<p>
							<p>Now, let your partner straddle this raised knee, facing away, so that yours and her world collide (part, collide, part, and collide again) just around the vagina and thigh.
