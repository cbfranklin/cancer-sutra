TODO
=====

- Replace menu-toggle with SVG alternative AND provide IE fallback (icon?)

- Decide on whether JSON is the way to feed data (with mustache)

- Write Modernizr logic into template logic/css logic to swap between SVG/JPG and SMIL/GIF

- position:fixed polyfill for early iOS devices



- nodejs backend for handling #/position/x requests from google

- nginx to replace apache and steer appropriate bot traffic to nodejs

- consider windows phone

- what other Modernizr tests do i need? [svg,position:fixed,history,nojs?]

-sie.js SVG polyfill doesnt seem to play nice with ANY <IMG> properties. i'll go full jpg/gif on IE8 for sure.

-IE9/10/11 tests
